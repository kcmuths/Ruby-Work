first, second, third = ARGV  

puts "Your first variable is: #{first}"

puts "Your second variable is : #{second}"

puts "Your third variable is : #{third}"

=begin
ARGV: this is the argument variable. What happens here is ARGV unpacks the assigned values. 
Basically take whatever is in ARGV and assign to first, second and third variable
NOTE: To run the program you ahve to pass the argv values during runtime.
Foe eg here: ruby ex13.rb first 2nd Three
=end
